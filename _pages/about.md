Welcome to my blog ! I'm Erdem Kece, a linux enthusiast who mainly focuses on Kubernetes especially OpenShift.
My fascination with technology and its ever-evolving nature has driven me to constantly learn and adapt in ten years of my carrier.
My mission with this blog is to create a resourceful and informative platform for fellow IT professionals, enthusiasts, and anyone curious about Red Hat OpenShift.
Please note that this blog is a personal endeavor. As such, the content here is solely my own and does not reflect the services or opinions of my employer.
